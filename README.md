# APATHY

This is a game about apathy.

For some, it is a near-debilitating condition -- not having concern, excitment,
motivation, or passion can lead to a state of depression, which can be a very
serious illness.

In this game you take on the role of a manifestation (a goat) of Apathy.


## Controls

The __LEFT__ and __A__ buttons move the goat left.

The __RIGHT__ and __D__ buttons move the goat right.

The __UP__ and __W__ buttons make the goat jump.
